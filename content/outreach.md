I always gets excited to take science to the public domain. I had involved in various outreach activities in my PhD times like teaching to underprivileged students near the institute, lab volunteer in the institute outreach program, talking to public during INO outreach at TIFR Mumbai. I constantly involved in the outreach organised by TIFRH, in which we had taken the science to the underprivileged school students in a simple reachable way. Please refer my web page for the details of the  [outreach reports](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS_syivtdWoBAwgQ8n3TFPtF-njyniGuyh2P52eATij_uvKm07v2KuHkFG7UCKapmIRC5Gh3a3TXAM0/pub).
