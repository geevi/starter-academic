<h2>Hello</h2>

I am currently a Post-doctoral Researcher working with [Prof. Haim Beindenkopf](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/condmat/WASP/group-members) at [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/). I am working on probing magnetic materials using scanning tunneling microscope. Parallely I am growing nanowires of topological material using Molecular Beam Epitaxial growth (MBE) chamber. Further studies of the nano-wires are in progress.

During my first post doc at [TIFR Hyderabad](https://www.tifrh.res.in/) with [Dr. Karthik V. Raman](https://www.tifrh.res.in/~raman) I was studying the proximity effects of magnetic materials on the surface states of a Topological Insulator. I was involved in instrumention during the building of the lab. My present research interest is on proximity induced superconductor. Currently, I am working on MgB2 thin films, high temperature BCS superconductor. 

Previously I did my [Phd thesis](http://www.ino.tifr.res.in/ino/theses/Thesis_Mathimalar.pdf) on NTD Ge sensor development for
superconducting bolometers.  In which, I had developed the Neutron Transmutation Doped Ge (NTD Ge) sensor for the superconducting Tin absorber which will be operating at 10mK. The NTD Ge sensors will be employed to detect the thermal pulse of the rare event decay called Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay (NDBD) in 124Sn absorber. The experiment The [INdia's TIN detector (TIN.TIN)](http://www.tifr.res.in/~tin.tin/) will be housed at the upcoming [India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO)](http://www.ino.tifr.res.in/ino/).
