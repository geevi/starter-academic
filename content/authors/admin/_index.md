<h2>Hello</h2>

I am currently a post doctoral fellow with [Prof. Haim Beidenkopf](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/condmat/WASP/home) at Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. At Weizmann, my research comprises of probing and analysing the weak localization in a magnetic material using scanning tunneling spectroscopic (STS) methods at low temperature. Apart from STS, I had also grown the topological nano-wires using Molecular Beam Epitaxial (MBE) growth chamber. Previously, I was a Post Doctoral fellow with [Dr. Karthik V. Raman](https://www.tifrh.res.in/~raman/index.php/people/) at TIFR, Hyderabad (TIFRH). At TIFRH I had proximitized topological insulator with a magnetic insulator and studied the signature of gate controlled magnetism and localization in the material. In my Ph.D. the research work was carried out on 'Low-temperature sensor development for the search of Majorana neutrino using the bolometric technique' for [The INdiaâ€™s TIN detector (TIN.TIN)](http://www.tifr.res.in/~tin.tin/) at [INO](http://www.ino.tifr.res.in/ino/), TIFR Mumbai.
